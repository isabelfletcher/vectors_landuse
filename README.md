# Differing taxonomic responses of mosquito vectors to anthropogenic land-use change in Latin America and the Caribbean


This repository contains R scripts used to produce analysis assessing the response of *Aedes* and *Anopheles* mosquito abundance and species richness to land use change.

The dataset of 10,004 mosquito abundance records across multiple land-use types at 632 sites across LAC was compiled using a systemeatic data search strategy. 
Models were then formulated for species-level abundance and species richness. Subsequently, the impact of recent (in the last five years) deforestation on mosquito biodiversity was also modelled. 



The analysis workflow is as follows:

Detection of best monthly time lags for including El Nino into spatiotemporal models of malaria incidence
Spatiotemporal modelling of malaria incidence in Bol√≠var state, southern Venezuela. This also included random effect analysis and testing for the interactions between environmental degradation and climate variation.
Visualisation of results
Preparation of supplementary material to support findings
Descriptive statistics included in the main text
Scripts used to extract measures of forest decrease and urbanization from land cover maps, for analysis are also included.
