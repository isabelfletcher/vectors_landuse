# Differing taxonomic responses of mosquito vectors to anthropogenic land-use change in Latin America and the Caribbean


This repository contains R scripts used to produce analysis assessing the response of *Aedes* and *Anopheles* mosquito abundance and species richness to land use change.

The dataset of 10,004 mosquito abundance records across multiple land-use types at 632 sites across LAC was compiled using a systemeatic data search strategy. Models were then formulated for species-level abundance and species richness. Subsequently, the impact of recent (in the last five years) deforestation on mosquito biodiversity was also modelled. 


The analysis workflow is as follows:

- Model selection procedure for selecting the best random effects structure for models of mosquito abundance and species richness
- Running of selected models
- Extracting percentage forest loss in last five years for primary and secondary vegetation sites 
- Conducting sensitivity analysis where influential data points are left out from models
- Visualisation of results
- Tables included in supplementary materials
- Descriptive statistics included in the main text
